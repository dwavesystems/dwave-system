DWave Native Embedding Algorithms
#################################

This is a repository for algorithms to generate native-structured embeddings.


System Requirements
===================

  * Python 2.7 or greater

Optional
--------

  * sphinx 1.4 or greater; required to build documentation
  * nose; required to run unit tests
  * dwave_sapi2 Python client; required to build documentation and run
    python examples
  * matlab and dwave_sapi2 matlab client; required to run matlab examples
  * c compiler and dwave_sapi2 c client; required to run c examples

Installation
============

To install the chimera_embedding module into your system-wide python,

    python setup.py install


Documentation
=============

The documentation is automatically generated by Sphinx.  The Python examples
are written to be parsed by the file doc/literate.py, which extracts the code
blocks and executes them to produce nice pseudo-interactive documentation.
Some examples produce files as a side-effect, and those files are necessary
for other examples.  Those dependencies are recorded in doc/Makefile.

To make the html documentation, 

    cd doc
    make html

or to make pdf documentation,

    cd doc
    make latexpdf


Unit Tests
==========

The file src/polynomialembedder.py has unit tests in the test directory.
As you develop more functionality, please make sure to add sensible unit
tests to the test directory.  To run the unit tests,

    nosetests test --with-coverage


Examples
========

Examples can be found in the examples directory.  The examples embed_clique.py
and embed_biclique.py both produce embedding files as a side-effect.  These
files are required to run the solve_clique.* and solve_biclique.* examples.

The c examples contain instructions to build them using gcc.
