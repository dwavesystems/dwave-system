Embedding

Provides functions that map binary quadratic models and samples between a source graph and a target graph.

The D-Wave 2000Q is Chimera-structured. The Chimera architecture comprises sets of
connected unit cells, each with four horizontal qubits connected to four vertical qubits
via couplers (bipartite connectivity). Unit cells are tiled vertically and horizontally
with adjacent qubits connected, creating a lattice of sparsely connected qubits. A unit
cell is typically rendered as either a cross or a column.

  A :math:`3 {\rm x} 3`  Chimera graph, denoted C3. Qubits are arranged in 9 unit cells.

Example
=======

As described in more detail in the :std:doc:`Boolean AND Gate <oceandocs:examples/and>`
example, a sampler may not natively support a given problem graph. For example, the D-Wave
system does not natively support :math:`K_3` graphs. The Boolean
AND gate (:math:`x_3 \Leftrightarrow x_1 \wedge x_2` where :math:`x_3` is the
AND gate's output and :math:`x_1, x_2` the inputs) may be
represented as penalty model

.. math::

    x_1 x_2 - 2(x_1+x_2)x_3 +3x_3.

This penalty model can in turn be represented as the QUBO,

.. math::

    E(a_i, b_{i,j}; x_i) = 3x_3 + x_1x_2 - 2x_1x_3 - 2x_2x_3,

which is a fully connected :math:`K_3` graph.

Sampling this problem on a D-Wave system, therefore, requires minor-embedding.
Embedding in this case is accomplished by an edge contraction operation on the
target graph: two nodes (qubits) are chained to represent a single node.

  :alt: Embedding a :math:`K_3` graph onto the D-Wave system's graph.

  Embedding an AND gate represented by a :math:`K_3` graph onto the D-Wave
  system's graph. The leftmost graph is the source graph, which is the QUBO
  representing the AND gate; the middle one is the target graph, representing
  the D-Wave system; and in the rightmost graph, qubits 0 and 4 of the D-Wave
  system's graph are chained to represent the single node :math:`z` of the
  source graph.

:std:doc:`minorminer <minorminer:index>` is a heuristic tool for minor embedding: given a
minor and target graph, it tries to find a mapping that embeds the minor into the target.
