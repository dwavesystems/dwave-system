Introduction
============

*dwave-system* enables easy incorporation of the D-Wave system as a
:term:`sampler`---the component used to find variable values that minimize the binary
quadratic model (BQM) representing a problem---in the typical Ocean
:std:doc:`problem-solving procedure <oceandocs:overview/solving_problems>`\ :

1. Formulate the problem as a BQM.
2. Solve the BQM with a sampler.

Example
=======
This example solves a small example of a known graph problem, minimum
`vertex cover <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertex_cover>`_\ . It uses the NetworkX
graphic package to create the problem, Ocean's :std:doc:`dwave_networkx <networkx:index>`
to formulate the graph problem as a BQM, and dwave-system's
:class:`~dwave.system.samplers.DWaveSampler()` to use a D-Wave system as the sampler.
(Access to a D-Wave system has been :std:doc:`set up <oceandocs:overview/dwavesys>` in
a configuration file that is used implicitly.) dwave-system's
:class:`~dwave.system.composites.EmbeddingComposite()` handles mapping between the problem graph
to the D-Wave system's numerically indexed qubits, a mapping known as :term:`minor-embedding`.

>>> import networkx as nx
>>> import dwave_networkx as dnx
>>> from dwave.system.samplers import DWaveSampler
>>> from dwave.system.composites import EmbeddingComposite
...
>>> s5 = nx.star_graph(4)  # a star graph where node 0 is hub to four other nodes
>>> sampler = EmbeddingComposite(DWaveSampler())
>>> print(dnx.min_vertex_cover(s5, sampler))

Using the D-Wave System as a Sampler
====================================

The :std:doc:`dimod <dimod:index>` API makes it possible to easily interchange samplers
in your code. For example, you might develop code using :std:doc:`dwave_neal <neal:index>`,
Ocean's simulated annealing sampler, and then swap in a D-Wave system
composed sampler.

:std:doc:`Using a D-Wave System <oceandocs:overview/dwavesys>` explains how you set up
access to a D-Wave system.

:std:doc:`D-Wave System Documentation <sysdocs_gettingstarted:index>` describes the
D-Wave system, its features, parameters, and properties. The documentation provides guidance
on programming the D-Wave system, including how to formulate problems and configure parameters.

.. _samplers:

Samplers
========

*Samplers* are processes that sample from low energy states of a problem’s :term:`objective function`.
A BQM sampler samples from low energy states in models such as those
defined by an Ising equation or a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem
and returns an iterable of samples, in order of increasing energy.

Ocean software provides a variety of :std:doc:`dimod samplers <dimod:reference/samplers>`, which
all support ‘sample_qubo’ and ‘sample_ising’ methods as well as the generic BQM sampler method.
In addition to :class:`~dwave.system.samplers.DWaveSampler()`, classical solvers, which run on CPU or GPU, are available and
useful for developing code or on a small versions of a problem to verify code.

.. _composites:

Composites
==========

Samplers can be composed. The `composite pattern <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_pattern>`_
allows layers of pre- and post-processing to be applied to binary quadratic programs without needing
to change the underlying sampler implementation. We refer to these layers as `composites`.
A composed sampler includes at least one sampler and possibly many composites.

Examples of composites are :class:`~dwave.system.composites.EmbeddingComposite()`,
used in the example above, and :class:`~dwave.system.composites.VirtualGraphComposite()`,
both of which handle the mapping known as :term:`minor-embedding`.


.. _minorEmbedding:

Embedding
=========

To solve an arbitrarily posed binary quadratic problem on a D-Wave system requires mapping,
called *minor embedding*, to a Chimera graph that represents the system's quantum processing unit.
This preprocessing can be done by a composed sampler consisting of the
:class:`~dwave.system.samplers.DWaveSampler()` and a composite that performs minor-embedding.

See the :ref:`embedding` section for more information on :term:`minor-embedding` and the
provided functionality.
