def diagnose_embedding(emb, source, target):
    """Diagnose a minor embedding.

    Produces a generator that lists all issues with the embedding. User-friendly
    variants of this function are :func:`is_valid_embedding`, which returns a
    bool, and :func:`verify_embedding`, which raises the first observed error.

    Args:
        emb (dict):
            A mapping of source nodes to arrays of target nodes as a dict
            of form {s: [t, ...], ...}, where s is a source-graph variable and t
            is a target-graph variable.

        source (list/:obj:`networkx.Graph`):
            Graph to be embedded as a NetworkX graph or a list of edges.

        target (list/:obj:`networkx.Graph`):
            Graph being embedded into as a NetworkX graph or a list of edges.

    Yields:
        Errors yielded in the form `ExceptionClass, arg1, arg2,...`, where the
        arguments following the class are used to construct the exception object,
        which are subclasses of :exc:`.EmbeddingError`.

            :exc:`.MissingChainError`, snode: a source node label that does not
            occur as a key of `emb`, or for which emb[snode] is empty.

            :exc:`.ChainOverlapError`, tnode, snode0, snode0: a target node which
            occurs in both `emb[snode0]` and `emb[snode1]`.

            :exc:`.DisconnectedChainError`, snode: a source node label whose chain
            is not a connected subgraph of `target`.

            :exc:`.InvalidNodeError`, tnode, snode: a source node label and putative
            target node label that is not a node of `target`.

            :exc:`.MissingEdgeError`, snode0, snode1: a pair of source node labels
            defining an edge that is not present between their chains.

    Examples:
        This example diagnoses an invalid embedding from a triangular source graph
        to a square target graph. A valid embedding, such as
        `emb = {0: [1], 1: [0], 2: [2, 3]}`, yields no errors.
