    Args:
        source_Q (dict[(variable, variable), bias]):
            Coefficients of a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) model.

        embedding (dict):
            Mapping from source graph to target graph as a dict of form {s: {t, ...}, ...},
            where s is a source-model variable and t is a target-model variable.

        target_adjacency (dict/:obj:`networkx.Graph`):
            Adjacency of the target graph as a dict of form {t: Nt, ...},
            where t is a target-graph variable and Nt is its set of neighbours.

        chain_strength (float/mapping/callable, optional):
            Magnitude of the quadratic bias (in SPIN-space) applied between
            variables to form a chain, with the energy penalty of chain breaks
            set to 2 * `chain_strength`.  If a mapping is passed, a
            chain-specific strength is applied.  If a callable is passed, it
            will be called on `chain_strength(source_bqm, embedding)`

            By default, `chain_strength` is calculated with
