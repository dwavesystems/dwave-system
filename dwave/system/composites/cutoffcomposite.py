class CutOffComposite(dimod.ComposedSampler):
    """Composite to remove interactions below a specified cutoff value.

    Prunes the binary quadratic model (BQM) submitted to the child sampler by
    retaining only interactions with values commensurate with the sampler's
    precision as specified by the ``cutoff`` argument. Also removes variables
    isolated post- or pre-removal of these interactions from the BQM passed
    on to the child sampler, setting these variables to values that minimize
    the original BQM's energy for the returned samples.

    Args:
       sampler (:obj:`dimod.Sampler`):
            A dimod sampler.

       cutoff (number):
            Lower bound for absolute value of interactions. Interactions
            with absolute values lower than ``cutoff`` are removed. Isolated variables
            are also not passed on to the child sampler.

       cutoff_vartype (:class:`.Vartype`/str/set, default='SPIN'):
            Variable space to execute the removal in. Accepted input values:

            * :class:`.Vartype.SPIN`, ``'SPIN'``, ``{-1, 1}``
            * :class:`.Vartype.BINARY`, ``'BINARY'``, ``{0, 1}``

       comparison (function, optional):
            A comparison operator for comparing interaction values to the cutoff
            value. Defaults to :func:`operator.lt`.

    Examples:
        This example removes one interaction, ``'ac': -0.7``, before embedding
        on a D-Wave system. Note that the lowest-energy sample for the embedded problem
        is ``{'a': 1, 'b': -1, 'c': -1}`` but with a large enough number of samples
        (here ``num_reads=1000``), the lowest-energy solution to the complete BQM is
        likely found and its energy recalculated by the composite.
