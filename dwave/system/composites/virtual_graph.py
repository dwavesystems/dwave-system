"""Deprecated and functionality removed. Behaves identically to
:class:`~dwave.system.composites.embedding.FixedEmbeddingComposite`, and will
be completely removed in dwave-system 2.0.

Virtual graphs are deprecated due to improved calibration of newer QPUs; to
calibrate chains for residual biases, follow the instructions in the
`shimming tutorial <https://github.com/dwavesystems/shimming-tutorial>`_.

A :std:doc:`dimod composite <oceandocs:docs_dimod/reference/samplers>` that
uses the D-Wave virtual graph feature for improved
:std:doc:`minor-embedding <oceandocs:docs_system/intro>`.

D-Wave *virtual graphs* simplify the process of minor-embedding by enabling you
to more easily create, optimize, use, and reuse an embedding for a given working
graph. When you submit an embedding and specify a chain strength using these
tools, they automatically calibrate the qubits in a chain to compensate for the
effects of biases that may be introduced as a result of strong couplings.

See `Ocean Glossary <https://docs.ocean.dwavesys.com/en/stable/concepts/index.html>`_
for explanations of technical terms in descriptions of Ocean tools.
