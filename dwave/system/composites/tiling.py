A :ref:`dimod composite <oceandocs:samplers_index>` that tiles small problems
multiple times to a structured sampler.

The :class:`.TilingComposite` class takes a problem that can fit on a small
:term:`Chimera` graph and replicates it across the larger working graph of
a quantum processing unit (QPU) to obtain samples from multiple areas of 
the QPU in one call.
For example, a single Chimera unit cell could be tiled over 600 times on a
fully-yielded Advantage system.

class TilingComposite(dimod.Sampler, dimod.Composite, dimod.Structured):
    """Composite to tile a small problem across a structured sampler.

    Enables parallel sampling on Chimera or Pegasus structured samplers of
    small problems. The small problem should be defined on a :term:`Chimera`
    graph of dimensions ``sub_m``, ``sub_n``, ``t``, or minor-embeddable to
    such a graph.

    Notation *PN* referes to a Pegasus graph consisting of a 3x(N-1)x(N-1) grid
    of cells, where each unit cell is a bipartite graph with shore of size t,
    supplemented with odd couplers (see ``nice_coordinate`` definition in
    the :func:`~dwave_networkx.pegasus_graph` function). The
    Advantage QPU supports a P16 Pegasus graph: its qubits may be mapped to a
    3x15x15 matrix of unit cells, each of 8 qubits. This code supports tiling of
    Chimera-structured problems, with an option of additional odd-couplers,
    onto Pegasus. See also the :func:`~dwave_networkx.pegasus_graph` function.

    Notation *CN* refers to a Chimera graph consisting of an NxN grid of unit
    cells, where each unit cell is a bipartite graph with shores of size t.
    (An earlier quantum computer, the D-Wave 2000Q, supported a C16 Chimera 
    graph: its 2048 qubits were logically mapped into a 16x16 matrix of unit 
    cells of 8 qubits (t=4). See also the :func:`~dwave_networkx.chimera_graph` 
    function.)

    A problem that can be minor-embedded in a single chimera unit cell, for
    example, can therefore be tiled as 3x15x15 duplicates across an Advantage 
    QPU (or, previously, over the unit cells of a D-Wave 2000Q as 16x16 
    duplicates), subject to solver yield. This enables over 600 (256 for the 
    D-Wave 2000Q) parallel samples per read.

    Args:
       sampler (:class:`~dimod.Sampler`): Structured dimod sampler such as a
           :class:`~dwave.system.samplers.DWaveSampler`.
       sub_m (int): Minimum number of Chimera unit cell rows required for
           minor-embedding a single instance of the problem.
       sub_n (int): Minimum number of Chimera unit cell columns required for
           minor-embedding a single instance of the problem.
       t (int, optional, default=4): Size of the shore within each Chimera unit
           cell.

    Examples:
       This example submits a two-variable QUBO problem representing a logical
       NOT gate to a D-Wave system. The QUBO---two nodes with biases of -1 that
       are coupled with strength 2---needs only any two coupled qubits and so is
       easily minor-embedded in a single unit cell.
       Composite :class:`.TilingComposite` tiles it multiple times for parallel solution:
       the two nodes should typically have opposite values.
