A :std:doc:`dimod composite <oceandocs:docs_dimod/reference/samplers>` that tiles small problems
multiple times to a Chimera-structured sampler.

The :class:`.TilingComposite` takes a problem that can fit on a small
:term:`Chimera` graph and replicates it across a larger
Chimera graph to obtain samples from multiple areas of the solver in one call.
For example, a 2x2 Chimera lattice could be tiled 64 times (8x8) on a fully-yielded
D-Wave 2000Q system (16x16).

See `Ocean Glossary <https://docs.ocean.dwavesys.com/en/stable/concepts/index.html>`_

class TilingComposite(dimod.Sampler, dimod.Composite, dimod.Structured):
    """Composite to tile a small problem across a Chimera-structured sampler.

    Enables parallel sampling for small problems (problems that are minor-embeddable in
    a small part of a D-Wave solver's :term:`Chimera` graph).

    Notation *CN* refers to a Chimera graph consisting of an NxN grid of unit cells, where
    each unit cell is a bipartite graph with shores of size t. The D-Wave 2000Q QPU
    supports a C16 Chimera graph: its 2048 qubits are logically mapped into a 16x16 matrix of
    unit cell of 8 qubits (t=4).

    A problem that can be minor-embedded in a single unit cell, for example, can therefore
    be tiled across the unit cells of a D-Wave 2000Q as 16x16 duplicates. This enables
    sampling 256 solutions in a single call.

    Args:
       sampler (:class:`dimod.Sampler`): Structured dimod sampler such as a :class:`~dwave.system.samplers.DWaveSampler()`.
       sub_m (int): Number of rows of Chimera unit cells for minor-embedding the problem once.
       sub_n (int): Number of columns of Chimera unit cells for minor-embedding the problem once.
       t (int, optional, default=4): Size of the shore within each Chimera unit cell.

    Examples:
       This example submits a two-variable QUBO problem representing a logical
       NOT gate to a D-Wave system. The QUBO---two nodes with biases of -1 that
       are coupled with strength 2---needs only any two coupled qubits and so is
       easily minor-embedded in a single unit cell.
       Composite :class:`.TilingComposite` tiles it multiple times for parallel solution:
       the two nodes should typically have opposite values.
