        The first element in each pair is a combination of the numbers of
        interactions, variables, and cases that reflects the "density" of
        connectivity between the problem's variables;
        the second is the minimum required time. The minimum time for any
        particular problem size is a linear interpolation calculated on
        two pairs that represent the relevant range for the given problem.

        Examples:
            For a solver where
            `LeapHybridDQMSampler().properties["minimum_time_limit"]` returns
            `[[1, 0.1], [100, 10.0], [1000, 20.0]]`, the minimum time for a
            problem of "density" 50 is 5 seconds (the linear interpolation of the
            first two pairs that represent problems with "density" between 1 to
            100).
