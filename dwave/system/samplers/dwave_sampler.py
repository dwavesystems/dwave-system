class DWaveSampler(dimod.Sampler, dimod.Structured):
    """A class for using D-Wave quantum computers as samplers for binary quadratic models.

    You can configure your :term:`solver` selection and usage by setting parameters,
    hierarchically, in a configuration file, as environment variables, or
    explicitly as input arguments. For more information, see
    `D-Wave Cloud Client <https://docs.ocean.dwavesys.com/en/stable/docs_cloud/sdk_index.html>`_
    :meth:`~dwave.cloud.client.Client.get_solvers`. By default, online
    D-Wave systems are returned ordered by highest number of qubits.

    Args:
        failover (bool, optional, default=False):
            Signal a failover condition if a sampling error occurs. When ``True``,
            raises :exc:`~dwave.system.exceptions.FailoverCondition` or
            :exc:`~dwave.system.exceptions.RetryCondition` on sampleset resolve
            to signal failover.

            Actual failover, i.e. selection of a new solver, has to be handled
            by the user. A convenience method :meth:`.trigger_failover` is available
            for this. Note that hardware graphs vary between QPUs, so triggering
            failover results in regenerated :attr:`.nodelist`,  :attr:`.edgelist`, 
            :attr:`.properties` and :attr:`.parameters`.

            .. versionchanged:: 1.16.0

               In the past, the :meth:`.sample` method was blocking and
               ``failover=True`` caused a solver failover and sampling retry.
               However, this failover implementation broke when :meth:`.sample`
               became non-blocking (asynchronous), Setting ``failover=True`` had
               no effect.

        retry_interval (number, optional, default=-1):
            Ignored, but kept for backward compatibility.

            .. versionchanged:: 1.16.0

               Ignored since 1.16.0. See note for ``failover`` parameter above.

        **config:
            Keyword arguments passed to :meth:`~dwave.cloud.client.Client.from_config`.

    Note:
        Prior to version 1.0.0, :class:`.DWaveSampler` used the ``base`` client,
        allowing non-QPU solvers to be selected.
        To reproduce the old behavior, instantiate :class:`.DWaveSampler` with
        ``client='base'``.

    Examples:
        This example submits a two-variable Ising problem mapped directly to two
        adjacent qubits on a D-Wave system. ``qubit_a`` is the first qubit in
        the QPU's indexed list of qubits and ``qubit_b`` is one of the qubits
        coupled to it. Other required parameters for communication with the system, such
        as its URL and an authentication token, are implicitly set in a configuration file
        or as environment variables, as described in
        `Configuring Access to D-Wave Solvers <https://docs.ocean.dwavesys.com/en/stable/overview/sapi.html>`_.
        Given sufficient reads (here 100), the quantum
        computer should return the best solution, :math:`{1, -1}` on ``qubit_a`` and
        ``qubit_b``, respectively, as its first sample (samples are ordered from
        lowest energy).

            anneal_schedule (list):
                An anneal schedule variation is defined by a series of pairs of floating-point
                numbers identifying points in the schedule at which to change slope. The first
                element in the pair is time t in microseconds; the second, normalized persistent
                current s in the range [0,1]. The resulting schedule is the piecewise-linear curve
                that connects the provided points.

        Raises:
            ValueError: If the schedule violates any of the conditions listed below.

            RuntimeError: If the sampler does not accept the `anneal_schedule` parameter or
                if it does not have `annealing_time_range` or `max_anneal_schedule_points`
                properties.

        As described in
        `D-Wave System Documentation <https://docs.dwavesys.com/docs/latest/doc_solver_ref.html>`_,
        an anneal schedule must satisfy the following conditions:

            * Time t must increase for all points in the schedule.
            * For forward annealing, the first point must be (0,0) and the anneal fraction s must
              increase monotonically.
            * For reverse annealing, the anneal fraction s must start and end at s=1.
            * In the final point, anneal fraction s must equal 1 and time t must not exceed the
              maximum  value in the `annealing_time_range` property.
            * The number of points must be >=2.
            * The upper bound is system-dependent; check the `max_anneal_schedule_points` property.
              For reverse annealing, the maximum number of points allowed is one more than the
              number given by this property.

        Examples:
            This example sets a quench schedule on a D-Wave system.
