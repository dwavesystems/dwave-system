    """A class for using the D-Wave system as a sampler.

    Uses parameters set in a configuration file, as environment variables, or
    explicitly as input arguments for selecting and communicating with a D-Wave
    system. For more information, see
    `D-Wave Cloud Client <https://docs.ocean.dwavesys.com/projects/cloud-client/en/latest/>`_.

    Inherits from :class:`dimod.Sampler` and :class:`dimod.Structured`.

    Args:
        config_file (str, optional):
            Path to a configuration file that identifies a D-Wave system and provides
            connection information.

        profile (str, optional):
            Profile to select from the configuration file.

        endpoint (str, optional):
            D-Wave API endpoint URL.

        token (str, optional):
            Authentication token for the D-Wave API to authenticate the client session.

        solver (dict/str, optional):
            Solver (a D-Wave system on which to run submitted problems) to select given
            as a set of required features. Supported features and values are described in
            :meth:`~dwave.cloud.client.Client.get_solvers`. For backward
            compatibility, a solver name, formatted as a string, is accepted.

        proxy (str, optional):
            Proxy URL to be used for accessing the D-Wave API.

        **config:
            Keyword arguments passed directly to :meth:`~dwave.cloud.client.Client.from_config`.

    Examples:
        This example submits a two-variable Ising problem mapped directly to qubits 0
        and 1 on a D-Wave system selected by explicitly requiring that it have these two
        active qubits. Other required parameters for communication with the system, such
        as its URL and an autentication token, are implicitly set in a configuration file
        or as environment variables, as described in
        `Configuring a D-Wave System <https://docs.ocean.dwavesys.com/en/latest/overview/dwavesys.html>`_.

        As described in
        `D-Wave System Documentation <https://docs.dwavesys.com/docs/latest/doc_solver_ref.html>`_,
        an anneal schedule must satisfy the following conditions:

            * Time t must increase for all points in the schedule.
            * For forward annealing, the first point must be (0,0) and the anneal fraction s must
              increase monotonically.
            * For reverse annealing, the anneal fraction s must start and end at s=1.
            * In the final point, anneal fraction s must equal 1 and time t must not exceed the
              maximum  value in the `annealing_time_range` property.
            * The number of points must be >=2.
            * The upper bound is system-dependent; check the `max_anneal_schedule_points` property.
              For reverse annealing, the maximum number of points allowed is one more than the
              number given by this property.
