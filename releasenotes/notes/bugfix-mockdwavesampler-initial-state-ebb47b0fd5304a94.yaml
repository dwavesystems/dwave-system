    The initial_state format for MockDWaveSampler().sample does not match that
    used by DWaveSampler(), and the handling in context of other parameters is
    also different. Some tests have been modified to work around the use of this
    parameter, it is not used elsewhere in the codebase, therefore the simplest
    solution is to remove it as a mocked parameter.
    Overloading of MockDWaveSampler for specific testing contexts is
    is recommended: depenendence on e.g. flux_biases, anneal_schedule,
    initial_state should be context specific.
fixes:

    Fix handling of initial_state kwarg for the sampling routine: instead of
    handling this parameter incorrectly an warning is thrown (parameter not
    mocked), as per other unsupported arguments.
